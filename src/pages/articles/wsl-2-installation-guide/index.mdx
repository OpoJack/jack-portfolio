**Windows Subsystem for Linux** is a tool developed by Microsoft that lets developers run a true GNU/Linux environment directly on Windows, without a virtual machine or dual-boot setup. This is the environment largely preferred by developers today because of the abundance of **tools** and **productivity** options only available on a UNIX-based OS.

[Read more about WSL here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)

This guide will help you get your environment set up, then make it pretty.

## ⚠️Pre-reqs⚠️

1. You must be running Windows 10 version 2004 and higher (Build 19041 and higher) or Windows 11, my experience is with Windows 11.
2. A computer with Hyper-V Virtualization support ([Guide here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v))
3. Use **vscode**

---

## ✅ Get Started ✅

## 1. Install Windows Terminal via Microsoft Store

This is a powerful terminal that will accommodate our environment with many options.

<Image src={terminal2} className="shadow-md" width="500 " height="212" />
<Image src={terminal1} className="shadow-md" width="1178 " height="520" />

## 2. Install WSL

Open Windows Powershell in **admin mode** then run:

```bash
wsl --install
```

**\*Reboot** after installation\*

## 3. Install Linux/Ubuntu

Use the following commands to check which distros are available to download.

```bash
wsl --list --online
```

In my case, I installed **Ubuntu**.

```bash
wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```

Once installed, you’ll be prompted to create a **username** and **password** for Linux. Lastly, run this command to receive some Linux updates. It will prompt you for your password, simply type it in and hit enter.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

## 4. Configure Windows Terminal

When you open the Terminal, it should default to Windows Powershell. Select the dropdown next to the new tab button and confirm your Linux OS is an option.

<Image src={configureTerminal} className="shadow-md" width="220" height="210" />
Open **Settings** -> **Startup** and change the **Default profile** to your Linux
OS. Save changes then close/open the Terminal to confirm changes.
<Image
  src={configureTerminal2}
  className="shadow-md"
  width="1178"
  height="607"
/>
### A. Custom font (Optional but recommended){' '}

Next you’ll want to install and apply the font “**MesloLGS NF**” because this font can display certain icons and glyphs
that will otherwise render an error box like \*\*[x]{' '}

[Download them here](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#fonts),
you only need to follow steps 1 & 2.

<Image src={customFont} className="shadow-md" width="494" height="189" />

Once installed, apply it to your Terminal in the Settings -> Profiles -> Defaults

<Image
  src={configureTerminal3}
  className="shadow-md"
  width="1178"
  height="607"
/>

Additionally, set your preferred Windows Terminal theme. There are only a couple included by default. To add more, consider [windowsterminalthemes.dev](https://windowsterminalthemes.dev/)

Once you select a theme, clicking “Get theme” will copy the color information to your clipboard. Back in the Terminal, select **Open JSON file** in the settings, I recommend using vscode for this.

Navigate to “schemes” and paste your color scheme into the array of other schemes.

  src={configureTerminal4}
  className="shadow-md"
  width="350"
  height="616"
/>

## 5. Install ZSH & OhMyZsh

This is my recommended preference, here you can read more about [zsh](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/) and [OhMyZsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)

Using your Terminal in Linux, run this command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y zsh
```

<Image src={installZsh} className="shadow-md" width="1259" height="719" />

Once installed, you should see zsh in /etc/shells by running:

```bash
cat /etc/shells
```

### A. OhMyZsh

OhMyZsh is a framework for managing zsh configs and plugins. Notably, it includes git as a default plugin. Run the entire following command:

```bash
sh -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)
```

<Image src={installZsh2} className="shadow-md" width="1243" height="719" />
When prompted, press y to set zsh as your default shell.

## 6. Powerlevel10k - The eye candy

[P10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) is a theme for zsh that adds rich visual features to the terminal. Here’s an example of some styles you can choose:

<Image src={powerlevel10k} className="shadow-md" width="582" height="387" />

To get started, run this whole command:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
```

Once complete, you must enable the theme in your **.zshrc** file. This file is located within your user folder in Linux. For example, in my Windows explorer it’s located here: **\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\jack**

| <Image src={linuxFilesystem} className="shadow-md" width="175" height="238" /> | <Image src={linuxFilesystem2} className="shadow-md" width="585" height="120" /> |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Open the file in a text editor and modify the line that says “ZSH_THEME=”robbyrussell” with:

```bash
ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
```

After saving the file, return to the terminal and run `zsh`
This will refresh the terminal and begin the P10k setup. Simply select the options that you like the most

**Congratulations, your terminal is in good shape. Now it just needs dev tools.
This section will focus on web-dev related tools. If you already use node, you can stop here.**

---

## What are node_modules?

Most web-projects these days have a list of **dependencies** they rely on- **packages** that they have imported to make the project work. You may be familiar with some popular packages such as react, express and jquery just to name a few.

It’s important to understand that these packages are often comprised of thousands of files, some small and some large. node_modules is **not** meant to be included in your github commits, due to their size and complexity. Instead, you are meant to download the core project, then download/install the dependencies independently.

The solution to this problem are **package managers**, of which I have included **npm** and **yarn**. Both fundamentally solve the same problem and the decision to use one or the other is up to you. See a deeper comparison between them [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-npm-and-yarn/).

## 7. Node/npm/nvm

Run the nvm(Node Version Manager) installer:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | zsh
```

Then run:

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
```

Once complete, you should have access to the nvm command line tool, run this to check:

```bash
nvm -v
```

This should return the version of nvm you’re running.

Next, install and use the LTS (Long Term Support) version of node by running these two commands:

```bash
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
```

nvm also installs npm (Node Package Manager), confirm it’s working by running:

```bash
npm -v
```

**Congratulations, you have node/npm/nvm**

## 8. Yarn

Yarn is another package manager, very similar to npm. Use one **or** the other for any particular project, **do not** attempt to use both for a single project as this will likely cause issues. To get started, run:

```bash
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list

sudo apt update && sudo apt install yarn
```

**Congratulations, you have yarn**

## 9. Putting it all together

Ultimately, setting all this up should provide a seamless development experience, so how does this all work in **practice**?
Once Linux is set up and you open vscode in Windows, you’ll be prompted to install a **WSL extension**. Install it and you’ll notice a small blue box at the bottom left of the window. **You’re now ready to start/clone a project and get to work!**

| <Image src={wslVscode} className="shadow-md" width="471" height="121" /> | <Image src={wslVscode2} className="shadow-md" width="256" height="106" /> |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

I recommend you create a folder for your projects within your user folder, for example:

**/home/`<YourUser>`/Projects**

When you open a project located inside Linux, your vscode will look like this:

<Image src={wslVscode3} className="shadow-md" width="459" height="59" />

Lastly, to easily open your project in vscode, simply navigate to the project folder in your Terminal and run:

```bash
code .
```
